# Surveillance-system-using-Raspberry-Pi
A surveillance system using Raspberry Pi. A camera is attached to the Pi 2. We are then able to monitor the live streaming video by visiting our website.

The files outside the main folder consist of the code to take a picture from the webcam and send it to our server space.

The python script uses the openCV and requests library. It takes a picture using the webcam and stores this picture in the present directory. The requests library is then used to send a http request to a php script running on our server. The image file is converted to a binary text file and sent to the php script. This php script takes and stores this file in a directory. When we access the website, another php script is called that displays the image that is stored in the directory.

The Video Streaming folder consists of the code that is used for the actual video streaming. The python file uses the opencv, Image and requests library. The compressed image frames are continuously send to the server, where the website displays it.
